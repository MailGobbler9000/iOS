Updated iOS Application Code

The MG9K is a smartdrop with strong technological features, this includes having a built-in scanner that is able to take the package’s barcode as input and outputs the barcode into the AWS database. With a populated database, the user is able to use the dedicated mobile application to unlock the dropbox and look at historic logs of received packages. There are quality of life features like an LED off/on indicator, a backdoor mechanism to access the innards of the mailbox without using the app, as well as swappable and rechargeable lithium batteries. This whole system is powered by one 12V battery making the size of the dropbox compact, low-power and lightweight.


The iOS app will allow the user to interact with the MG9000. The final product will allow the user to unlock the mailbox’s package compartment, see the logs of barcodes and finally upload the barcode into the cloud. There's also added functionality of deleting past inputted barcodes from the database.
